<b>0. GLOSSARY:
===========</b>

bios	Is the part of the bios which is witten in Z80 assembler. It acts as
	a client to the yaze-bios. Here are central definitions (drive
	tables, yaze control table (YCT), ...) which are essential for the
	whole system.

yaze-bios  Is the part of the bios which is written in C outsite of the z80
           core and bios. It acts as a server to the bios.

<a name="features">&nbsp;</a>
<b>1. FEATURES:
============</b>

I took the idea of the page tables from Michael Hardt and built a simulated
MMU.  The default definitions of the MMU are 16 tables with 16 page pointers
(page size 4 KB) per table.

You can run on yaze-ag-2.51.3 CP/M 2.2 or superdos (file: yaze.boot) with or
without the MMU and 64 KB like the older version yaze-1.10 or you can run
CP/M 3.1 or ZPM3 from Simeon Cran (file: yaze-cpm3.boot) always with the
MMU and RAM up to 1MB.
You can start CP/M 3.1 by simply executing the file CPM3.COM under CP/M 2.2
or CP/M 3.1 (for example with a new bios version). The new CP/M 3.1
loader BOOTSYS (see above) relocates and starts the appended CPM3.SYS and
if CP/M 3.1 is running firstly all will be transferred from bank 1 (TPA)
to bank 0 (SYS bank) with an interbank move (XMOVE/MOVE).

The CP/M 3.1 bios (acts as a client to the yaze-bios) and the yaze-bios
(ybios.c) uses the MMU intensive like a real Z80 CP/M 3.1 System
(destination/source bank for read/write disk and interbank moves, multi-i/o
is also implemented).

Ten new options are described in the Makefile.

Following features are implemented:

	simz80.c	The Z80 interpreter. I made some optimizations and
			made the necessary changes to embed the MMU.
			(See above the file simz80.c, the option -DMMU and
			 above "Optimizing".)

	simz80_wts.c	The same as simz80.c, but "with t-states" of each Z80
			intruction and the software extension to run the Z80
			interpreter at a interaktive defined clock rate (see
			"clock" command in the monitor).
			This software extension is independent of the clock
			rate of the host processor! It uses the real time clock
			(RTC) of the Unix/Linux/Windows system.

	MMU		with 16 tables to 16 page pointers (page size 4 KB).
			A bank switch over the bios is simple done with a
			pointer and so very fast (see *mmu in the new module
			mem_mmu.[hc]).
			I made a lot of changes in all modules to embed
			the MMU in the whole system.
			You can run CP/M 3.1 (bootfile: yaze-cpm3.boot)
			or CP/M 2.2 (bootfile: yaze.boot) on yaze-ag-2.51.3.
			You can start CP/M 3.1 by simply executing CPM3.COM
			(bootsys.com+cpm3.sys).
			(yaze-cpm3.boot is identically with a:cpm3.com)

	BOOTSYS		Bootsys is a new CPM3.SYS loader. It was necessary
			because the CPM3.SYS grows over 32K and the CPMLDR
			or ZPM3LDR does not load this big file.
			(See above "Some words to BOOTSYS".)

	CP/M 3.1	All fundamental and essential functions are made for
			running CP/M 3.1 .

     The following features are not necessary but CP/M 3.1 supports it:

	DATE		implemented

	XMOVE/MOVE	implemented - this supports sector size > 128 Bytes
			(Default sector size is now 2048 bytes.)

	MULTIO		multi-i/o is also implemented and runs very well.

	Mounting Directories
			special feature to import directories into the
			emulator by connecting them to CP/M drives. By that
			way you can easily import files into the emulator.

			The new feature since version 2.12 is that the update
			time stamps are imported into the simulated CP/M
			directory.
			Look to chapter 
			7. <a href="#mounting_dir">Mounting directories with Time Stamps</a>
			in this document.

	Import/Export utilities
			Since version 2.30 you can import files with the
			utility R.COM without exiting the emulator.
			Also with W.COM you can export files to the host
			system without exiting the emulator. Look to
			chapter 8. <a href="#import_export">Import and Export utilities</a>

	serial lines	since version 2.20 you can use the serial lines of
			your computer. Look to chapter 9. <a
			href="#serial_lines">Serial Lines</a>.
		
Following features are NOT implemented

	char devices	not implemented - You can attach e.g. serial lines
			to the AUX: device in the monitor of yaze-ag.

<a name="development">&nbsp;</a>
<b>2. DEVELOPMENT:
================</b>

I developed under Solaris 8 (sparcv9) and Linux (kernel 2.4.x/2.6.x) and used
gcc version 3.x.x also under Solaris. I tested yaze-ag-2.20 on
FreeBSD and DEC-Unix (alpha processor) - it works also there.

I tried to use the SPARC-C-Compiler (cc) under Solaris. Everything will be
compiled but yaze-ag does not run. I don't know why and so I use the gcc also
for SPARC machines.

I had a lot of fun in developing the bios and the yaze-bios for CP/M 3.1,
but sometimes I was stunned - but I found the errors :-) .
(see above section "My old real Z80 system")

The known bug of version 2.01 is solved. I add the more feature to import
the modification time of the unix files as update time under CP/M.
Look Chapter 7 "<a href="#mounting_dir">Mounting directories with Time Stamps</a>" in this document.

Since the pre release 2.00 you can use the "cdm" utility (CP/M Disk Manager)
also under Linux.

I have finished with this development cycle. Look to Chapter "<a href="#fixed_bugs">FIXED BUGS</a>"
and chapter "<a href="#serial_lines">Serial Lines</a>".

Today 16. February 2022 there are no known bugs in version 2.51.3.

<b>3. Fixed BUGS:
==============</b>

Timothy Wagner and Carl Mascott reports a complex bug in yaze-ag-2.00.
I found this error also when I work with the emulator (and with drives
which are connected to a unix directory) and so I test also the old
version yaze-1.10. This bug is also in yaze-1.10! I take the code to
access unix directories from yaze-1.10 (see old version on the web page).


Bug report 1:
When you use the feature to connect a directory to a CP/M drive (A: - P:)
this works if you use it to copy files from a directory to a disk-file under
yaze-ag.
But if you use it to import files from a Directory to compile sources
and run programms while you edit source files with vi under Unix/Linux
the emulator crashes after some time when you often access files on the
drive which are connected to a directory.

<b><font color="#008000">THIS BUG IS FIXED IN VERSION 2.01 !!!</font></b>


Bug report 2:
When you have two unix files like "Source.z80" and "source.z80" this are
two different files under unix. CP/M does not handle upper and lower case
of file names. All file names are holded upper case in the CP/M directories.
When a unix directory was mounted and there was files like the two z80 files
yaze-1.10 and yaze-ag-2.00 creates two CP/M directory entries with the name
"SOURCE.Z80". This was a problem and the emulator crashes.

<b><font color="#008000">THIS BUG IS FIXED IN VERSION 2.01 !!!</font></b>


Bug report 3:
When you use also the feature to mount unix directories to a CP/M drive,
the problem is that if you edit a file with vi or nedit under unix the
emulator don't know about this changes or new files until you make a "remount".

<b><font color="#008000">THIS REREAD BUG IS FIXED IN VERSION 2.10 !!!</font></b>

<b>Have a look to chapter 7 "<a href="#mounting_dir">Mounting directories with Time Stamps</a>".</b>


Bug 4 which I found:
When you use also the feature to mount unix directories to a CP/M drive,
the problem was that when the filesize of a file was multiple of exactly
16K (16k,32K...) the last 16k can not read. If a file was exactly 16k you
only get the first 128 Byte when you make a "type" on a source file for
example. It was a chance to find this bug, The bug was in the simulated
directory for CP/M when you connect a Unix directory to a CP/M drive.

<b><font color="#008000">THIS SIMULATION DIRECTORY BUG IS FIXED IN VERSION 2.20.1 !!!</font></b>

<b>Its recommended to update the executable to this version 2.20.1 !!!</b>


In yaze-ag-2.51.3 there are no known bugs! I mean there are no further
errors but if you find one feel free and send an email to me. If you miss
a feature feel free and send an email to me, too.

<b>===========================================
4. Some words to BOOTSYS (CP/M 3.1 loader):
===========================================</b>

The BIOS3 under Z80 (acts as an client to the yaze-bios (ybios.c) with the
files BIOSKRNL.Z80, YDRVTBL.Z80, MMU.Z80, YCT.Z80 and SCB.Z80, linked with
BNKBDOS3.SPR and RESBDOS3.SPR to CPM3.SYS by GENCPM.COM (see drive P:))
supports all 16 drives from A: to P: .
All tables for these drives (defined in YDRVTBL) are very big - CPM3.SYS
is 43KB! All tables are defined to handle disks up to 64 MB. Greater disks
will not work, but it is possible to create them in the monitor in yaze-ag (and
cdm) and then you have to change the definitions in YDRVTBL.Z80/SYSDEF.LIB.

When CPM3.SYS gets over 34KB, CPMLDR (ZPM3LDR cannot run with my loader
bios ?!?!) cannot load this big file (I don't know why and I don't want to
debug it). So I had to look for another way to load CPM3.SYS. I search for
informations of the file structure of CPM3.SYS. So I developed BOOTSYS.Z80.
It relocates the resident and banked part (if present) held in the joined
CPM3.SYS and jumps into the bios to start CP/M 3.1.

| BOOTSYS works very well. BOOTSYS.Z80 is written, so that BOOTSYS runs also
| on a real CP/M System. If the cp/m vectors are present BOOTSYS prints the
| messages over the bios (conout), if not, it uses the yaze-bios directly
| over the HALT instruction. BOOTSYS should be run always under a real
| Z80 CP/M 2.2 system to start CP/M 3.1 (I use Z80 instructions).

If CP/M 3.1 is always running BOOTSYS try to move BOOTSYS+CPM3.SYS from
bank 1 to bank 0 switch to bank 0 and relocates and start CP/M 3.1.
Under YAZE-AG-2.30.2 BOOTSYS is in the position to start always CP/M 3.1
under CP/M 3.1! WHY?
In YAZE-AG-2.51.3 the XMOVE and MOVE routines are definded outside the Z80
memory in C and the short routines to call the yaze-bios are in the resident
part of the bios, so all works well under YAZE-AG-2.51.3.
If in a real Z80 CP/M 3.1 system the XMOVE/MOVE routines are placed in the
banked part of a bios (possible if a DMA make the interbank transfere) then
it can be that this parts will be overwritten when bootsys+cpm3.sys are
transfered from bank 1 to bank 0. In this case you can not make a new start
of CP/M 3.1 under CP/M 3.1. You must run CPM3.COM from CP/M 2.2 (You generate
CPM3.COM by "PIP CPM3.COM=BOOTSYS.COM,CPM3.SYS").

How BOOTSYS works and what conditions are necessary to run under CP/M 3.1
is described in README_BOOTSYS.

BOOTSYS+CPM3.SYS is also in the file yaze-cpm3.boot which is loaded instead
of yaze.boot if the C-compiler option -DBOOTSYS is defined in the Makefile.
It is the same file like CPM3.COM on drive A: . I transfer it to Unix/Linux
and rename it yaze-cpm3.boot.

<a name="monitor_commands">&nbsp;</a>
<b>5. New option and new monitor commands
======================================</b>

You can call yaze-ag with the option '<b>-1</b>'. This option force sector size
128 bytes. Normally sector size is 2048 bytes under CP/M 3.1. Under
CP/M 2.2 yaze-ag uses always sector size 128 bytes.

If you go with the sys.com utility into the monitor you can give the new
command '<b>128</b>'. This forces sector size 128 byte, too.

This option was necessary because some disk edited utilities (like B:DED.COM)
does not work with sektor size 2048.

The command '<b>setaccess on/off</b>' switch on/off the access time for mounted
directories connected to a CP/M drive. The update time is always on.
Create time stamps are not supported by the host systems.

I expand the mount command. If you give "<b>mount -v</b>" you will get very detail
informations about the connected drives/directories if you have started
CP/M 3.1.

<a name="CPM_disks">&nbsp;</a>
<b>6. CP/M disks
=============</b>

I describe here only the changes in the disk header of a &lt;CPM_Disk&gt; (.ydsk files).
Look for details to chapter 6. "<a href="yaze_doc.html#cpmdisks">CP/M disks</a>" in <a href="yaze_doc.html">yaze.doc</a>.

The new disk header occupies the first 128 BYTES of the file and has the
new format:

          0 -   9    &lt;CPM_Disk&gt;
         10 -  15    a null-terminated ascii comment (may be empty)
     new 16          version (0 = yaze-1.06/1.10, 1 = yaze-ag-2.xx)
         17 -  31    a null-terminated ascii comment (may be empty)
         32 -  33    sectors per track
         34          block shift factor
         35          block mask
         36          extent mask
         37 -  38    disk size max
         39 -  40    directory max
         41          al0
         42          al1
         43 -  44    check size (always zero)
         45 -  46    track offset
     new 47          psh (used if version=1 and CP/M 3.1 is running)
     new 48          phm ( "   "    "   "    "   "   "   "    "    )
         49 - 127    unused (zeros)

If version is 0 the sektor size is set to 128 bytes (psh=0, phm=0) in the DPB
of the corresponding drive. Psh and phm are only used under CP/M 3.1 if
version is 1.

You can alway transfere disk files between an old version of yaze (1.06/1.10)
and yaze-ag-2.51.3. The new disks looks under yaze-1.10 like a disk with sektor
size 128 bytes. The new fields are ignored. You can also use your old disk
files of yaze-1.10/1.06 under yaze-ag-2.51.3. The field "version" is in disk
files from yaze-1.10/1.06 always 0.

The fields version, psh and phm are used only in yaze-ag-2.xx and if CP/M 3.1
is running. The default sektor size is 2048 bytes (psh=4, phm=15).

I change also the default value of sektors per track to 128. (The old value
was 26).

You can set 128 byte sektors (psh=0, phm=0) for all disk with the flag "-1"
or the new monitor command "128".
This was necessary because some disk edited utlilities (like DED.COM)
does not work with sektor size 2048 bytes.

<a name="mounting_dir">&nbsp;</a>
<b>7. Mounting directories with Time Stamps
========================================</b>

This chapter describes the special feature to import directories into the
emulator by connecting them to CP/M drives. That way you can easily import
files into the emulator.

(An another way to import files is to use the cdm utility (CP/M disk manager).
 Only with cdm you can also export files (see man page cdm.1 or <a href="cdm.1.html">cdm(1)</a>). )

But you can also use the feature "Mounting Directories" to compile/assemble
source files which you import over a drive which is connected to a directory.
That way you can edit files with vi or an another editor under unix and
compile it inside yaze-ag. You can use the make.com utility which is on A:
(disk file: BOOT_UTILS) because the update time stamps are imported from
the host system and are present in the simulated CP/M directory!
(Look above the submit file examples in this chapter!)

But you have to take notice of some things:

1. The mounted directory is always read only.
2. You have to syncronise the simulated directory inside yaze-ag / CP/M and the
   directory of the host which is connected to a CP/M drive.

The second point means: If you change a file with an editor under Unix the
CP/M inside yaze-ag don't knows about these changes --> you must sync the
simulated directory under CP/M with the connected unix directory.
At that moment CP/M knows about changed and new files in the unix directory.

To sync (reread) the mounted directories you have four ways to do this:

a) CTRL-C at the command prompt (CCP).
b) to use the utility "resetdsk.com" (see A: disk file BOOT_UTILS).
c) to use the monitor command "sys remount &lt;drive&gt;"
d) to use the monitor command "sys mount &lt;drive&gt; &lt;directory-path&gt;"

'a' is for online use.
'b', 'c' and 'd' is for use in a submit file.

<b><u>To a) (CTRL-C):</u></b>

 the left side is for CP/M          the right side is the host on which yaze-ag
 inside yaze-ag			    runs (for example an unix host)
 (C: is connected to ./disksort/)

I make in CP/M:

A>C:
C>3dir disksort.c

  NAME                UPDATE
----------  ...  ----------------
DISKSORT.C       14/04/2004 10:20

<b>notice:</b> the time is 10:20

				then I make under unix:

					$ pwd
					.../disksort
					$ date
					Wed Apr 14 17:44:01 MEST 2004
					$ touch disksort.c

					  <b>notice:</b> with touch I set the
					  	  time to 17:44:xx

then I make in CP/M:

C>3dir disksort.c

  NAME                UPDATE
----------  ...  ----------------
DISKSORT.C       14/04/2004 10:20

 <b>notice:</b> the time is still 10:20

C>
C>
C><b>^C   (<--- give CTRL-C !!!)</b>
C>        (this makes a reread of ./disksort/)
C>
C>
C>3dir disksort.c

  NAME                UPDATE
----------  ...  ----------------
DISKSORT.C       14/04/2004 17:44
			    <b>^^^^^
notice:			      |</b>
The time of disksort.c is now <b>/</b>
 
Technical Background: 
When you give a CTRL-C at the Command prompt CP/M resets the whole disk system.
At the next bios call of seldsk (select disk) CP/M say in a flag "first 
access to this drive". Any further calls of seldsk to the same drive have not
set this flag. I use this flag to make a reread of the unix directory.

If you want to show also the access time stamps of a mounted directory
see the monitor command "setacces on/off" in the chapter 5
"<a href="#monitor_commands">New option and new monitor commands</a>".
(I can not set "access time stamps" in the LabelByte of the disk label
 because CP/M tries to update the access time when you access a file in the
 (unix) directory (directories are always read only). DIR.COM shows the
 access time but say it is the creation time. 3DIR.COM of the ZINC project
 (drive F:) say correctly access time.)

When you force a reread of a mounted directory also the changed size of each
file is updated.

<u>                                                                         </u>

The following submit file examples are on drive D: which is connected to
the disk file disksort.ydsk. It contains the DISKSORT project. These disk
file is formated with INITDIR.COM (see "HELP INITDIR") and in the
label "DISKSORT" the update time stamps are set (see "HELP SET LABEL" and
"HELP SET TIME-STAMPS").
The source files are in the (unix-)subdirectory ./disksort/ which is
connected to the CP/M drive C:

<b><u>To b):</u></b>

To use the "resetdsk.com" utility is like CTRL-C. It resets the disk system
over the BDOS call no 37 .

You can use "resetdsk.com" in the following example:

	D.sub:
	
	;
	resetdsk
	;
	; this resets the whole disk system (all disks).
	;
	;
	; Now compile the source
	;
	make -f disksort.mak $1
	;
	; This makefile makes a time comparison between the source files
	; on drive C: (connected to unix directory ./disksort, read-only)
	; and the compiled rel-files on drive D: (connected to the disk file
	; "DISKSORT.dsk", read-write).
	; Drive D: (the target) must initialized with INIRDIR.COM
	; (see "HELP INITDIR") and you must create a label and update time with
	; "SET [NAME=&lt;LABEL-NAME&gt;,UPDATE=ON] (see "HELP SET").
	;

NOTICE: The example D.Sub is on D: and you have to call this submit file from
	D: (Look to the rules in the make file disksort.mak).



<b><u>To c):</u></b>

To use the monitor command "sys remount &lt;drive&gt;" is the same as resetdsk.com.
It's only an another way.

	DD.sub:
	
	;
	sys remount c
	;
	; this resets drive C: (it must be connected to a directory). 
	;
	;
	; Now compile the source
	;
	make -f disksort.mak $1
	;
	; This makefile makes a time comparison between the source files
	; on drive C: (connected to unix directory ./disksort, read-only)
	; and the compiled rel-files on drive D: (connected to the disk file
	; "DISKSORT.dsk", read-write).
	; Drive D: (the target) must initialized with INIRDIR.COM
	; (see "HELP INITDIR") and you must create a label and update time with
	; "SET [NAME=&lt;LABEL-NAME&gt;,UPDATE=ON] (see "HELP SET").
	;

NOTICE: The example DD.Sub is on D: and you have to call this submit file
	from D:


<b><u>To d):</u></b>

To use the monitor command "sys mount &lt;drive&gt; &lt;directory-path&gt;" is not the
same as the last examples:

	DDD.sub:
	
	;
	sys mount c ./disksort/
	;
	; this (re)mounts the directory ./disksort to CP/M drive C:
	; (this is like a remount)
	;
	;
	; Now compile the source
	;
	make -f disksort.mak $1
	;
	; This makefile makes a time comparison between the source files
	; on drive C: (connected to unix directory ./disksort, read-only)
	; and the compiled rel-files on drive D: (connected to the disk file
	; "DISKSORT.dsk", read-write).
	; Drive D: (the target) must initialized with INIRDIR.COM
	; (see "HELP INITDIR") and you must create a label and update time with
	; "SET [NAME=&lt;LABEL-NAME&gt;,UPDATE=ON] (see "HELP SET").
	;

NOTICE: DDD.Sub is on D: and you have to call this submit file from D:

The difference between this submit file and the previous submit files is
that you can have different submit files on different drives. 
Each submit file uses an another directory path for drive C: and so you can
compile different projects on different disk files.

"sys mount &lt;drive&gt; &lt;directory-path&gt;" (re)mounts a directory.
The mount command (of the monitor) makes internally first an unmount of the
&lt;drive&gt; and then reads the whole directory which is give as the second
parameter &lt;directory-path&gt;.
CP/M in Yaze-ag knows at this moment about new and changed files in the
unix directory &lt;directory-path&gt;.

<b>8. Import and Export utilities R.COM and W.COM:
===============================================</b>

Since version 2.30 there exists two utilities for import and export
files from and to the host system.

With the R.COM utility you can import files from the host system
into the emulator without exiting the emulator!
When you call R.COM without a parameter it tells you how you use it:

	A>r

	READ V-2.23-3.01 (20-Jan-2017) YAZE-AG V2.51
	Usage: R &lt;file name&gt; [U]
	Binary copy &lt;file name&gt; from host environment. U = use upper case for name.

	Examples
	R bdos.mac        copy bdos.mac to BDOS.MAC
	R bdos.mac U      copy BDOS.MAC to BDOS.MAC
	R *.mac           copy all files ending with .mac
	R a:bdos.mac      copy bdos.mac to A:BDOS.MAC
	R a:*.com         copy all .COM files to A:
	R src/bdos.mac    copy src/bdos.mac to BDOS.MAC
	R src/a:bdos.mac  copy src/bdos.mac to BDOS.MAC on A:
	R src/*.mac       copy all .mac files from directory SRC
	R src/*.MAC U     copy all .MAC files from directory src
	R src/a:test.*    copy all test.* files from directory src to A:

	A>

With the W.COM utility you can export files to the host system
from the emulator without exiting the emulator!
When you call W.COM without a parameter it tells you how you use it:

	A>w

	WRITE V-1.17-3.10 (28-Apr-2020)  YAZE-AG V2.51
	Usage: W &lt;file name&gt; [B|T]
	Copy &lt;file name&gt; to host environment. Default is text, B for binary, T for Text

	Examples
	w bdos.mac        copy BDOS.MAC as text file "bdos.mac"
	w pip.com b       copy PIP.COM as binary file
	w pip.com         copy PIP.COM as binary file [.COM .REL .DAT .ARC imply B]
	w test.dat t      copy TEST.DAT as text file
	w *.com           copy all files matching *.COM as binary files
	w src/bdos.mac    copy BDOS.MAC to "./src/bdos.mac" as a text file
	w june/*.com b    copy *.COM to directory "./june" as binary files
	w source/*.spl t  copy *.SPL to directory "./source" as text files

	Files with the same name on the host will be overwritten without any query!

	A>

The utilities are written in SPL (Simple Program Language) and compiled
with the SPL environment which is on drive L: (spl.ydsk).
The submit file Y.SUB compiles YWRITE.SPL and link it to A:W.COM.
The submit file Z.SUB compiles YREAD.SPL and link it to A:R.COM.

<a name="serial_lines">&nbsp;</a>
<b>9. Serial Lines:
================</b>

With the "attach"-command in the monitor you can handle the serial lines:
(You call the monitor with "sys.com" and no parameter.)

	For Solaris on SUN-Machines the device is
		/dev/ttya	for the first serial port
		/dev/ttyb	for the second serial port

	For Linux (PC) the device is
		/dev/ttyS0	for COM1
		/dev/ttyS1	for COM2
		...

	For Cygwin the device is
		/dev/ttyS0 or /dev/com1	for COM1
		/dev/ttyS1 or /dev/com2 for COM2
		...

	How the devices is called in MAC OS X I dont't
	know.

You can write the attach command into the .yazerc file (edit it
with vi in Unix/Linux or with the metapad.exe in Windows).
Then you have always the serial line connected.
The command you must write is:

	attach aux /dev/ttyS0	(for example)

This connects the aux-device of CP/M 3 with the device in
Unix/Linux/Windows. 

Then you have to make a Nullmodem cable to connect the two computers.
(You must see in your technical documentation of your computer.
I have cables which uses on the PC side the 9-pole connector and on
the side of the Z280-Computer also a 9-pole connector, but with an
another pin content)

On the disk-file "Kermit_SZRZ.ydsk" are the programms kermit.com, sz.com
and rz.com (ZModem). With them you can connect to the other computer and
transfere data.

Baud rate:	You use the "DEVICE.COM" programm under CP/M 3 to set
		the baud rate. On my Z280 Computer (CPU280 by Reh Designe)
		I can set the baud rate in the Setup-routine of the
		boot loader.

		In Unix/Linux you use the "stty" programm.(look "man stty")
		Kermit (called ckermit) is available for Unix/Linux.
		With the kermit.com inside YAZE-AG when yaze_bin runs
		you can also communicate with a real CP/M computer.

		Under Windows you can use the Hyperterminal to initialize
		the COM-Port. I have an Icon with the Baud rate 19200
		on my desktop, which calls the hypterterminal and initialice
		the COM-Port to 19200 Baud. By the way Hyperterm understand
		also the kermit-protocol. So you can exchange Data between
		a real CP/M Computer and a Windows computer.
		With the kermit.com inside YAZE-AG when yaze_bin.exe runs
		you can also communicate with a real CP/M computer.

	I tried higher transfer rates than 19200, but only 19200 or
	less works with a CP/M-computer !!!

	When you connect two PC-Computers with the serial chip which have
	a FIFO for 10 characters, you can go up to a baud rate of 110000.


For example I have the following situation to develop for my Z280-System
(called CPU280 by Reh Design (Tilmann Reh)):

				`-----------------------'

- I'am sitting at my Notebook. With notepad++ I edit C-sources which I
  put over CIFS/SMB with Samba on the Hard disk(HD) of the Linux-Server.

- With the function "<a href="#mounting_dir">Mounting directories with Time Stamps</a>" (described
  also in this document) I import the edit files into YAZE-AG. I have
  a connection over the SSH-Client PUTTY to a running YAZE-AG on the
  Linux-Server. So I can compile the C-sources with a make utility with
  the HI-C-Z280-Compiler inside YAZE-AG from my Notebook.
  (The HI-C-Compiler is very slow, but on the Linux-Server with a
   CPU clock of 2.66 GHz it is a little bit faster <img src="happy.gif"
   align="bottom"> )

- The AUX device of the CP/M inside YAZE-AG is attached to /dev/ttyS0 (COM1)
  of the Linux-System.

- At the Keyboard/Monitor of the Z280 system I start kermit (it uses AUX of
  CP/M 3 which is connected to the serial Port CRT2).
  I also start kermit inside YAZE-AG on the Linux-Server to transfere the
  compiled programm data from YAZE-AG on the Server to the Z280 system.

- The software which I write for the Z280 uses the UART which is inside the
  Z280 CPU. I see the output at the UART of the Z280-programm in the
  Hyperterminal at my Notebook and so I can control the software in the
  Z280 system.

<a name="Keytranslation">&nbsp;</a>
<b>10. Keytranslation:
===================</b>

The keytranslation module was written by Jon Saxton.
It let you use the cursor keys of the PC in the command line of
CP/M 3.1 and in Wordstar or other wordstar compatible editors.
Also you can put "strings" on function-key and many more.

Look to the PDF "yaze-keys.pdf" to see how the keytranslation works and
how you use it.

By default the keytranslation-table "yaze.ktt" is loaded by yaze-ag.
There are 3 KTT-files: yaze.ktt, m2.ktt and sample.ktt.
m2.ktt is for the editor in the Turbo-Modula-2.
sample.ktt are samples.

With the A:KTT.COM inside the emulator you can change the ktt-file.
The ktt-files are in the host system Unix/Linux or Windows, NOT inside
the emulator!

<a name="Coordinates_of_the_terminal_emulator">&nbsp;</a>
<b>11. The coordinates of the terminal emulator (lines, columns) are now determined automatically over a window size handler
=========================================================================================================================</b>

The yaze-ag binary (yaze_bin) determines over a window size handler (Unix/Linux
signal routine) the coordinates of the used Terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-
terminal, mintty(Cygwin/Windows), ...). These coordinates are putting into the
lines and columns variables of the SCB (System Control Block) of CP/M 3.1.

The system programs of CP/M 3.1 (like TYPE.COM, DIR.COM, ...) and also the
patched Wordstar (see the next chapter and drive A:) retrieves then these
coordinates from the SCB over the standardized BDOS-interface (call to 0005H)
of CP/M 3.1.

The window size handler will be activated when you change the coordinates of
the terminal emulator and updates the lines and columns in the SCB.
Then a message is generate with the current lines and columns.


<a name="Wordstar_and_the_win_size_handler">&nbsp;</a>
<b>12. Wordstar and the window size handler
========================================</b>

Jon Saxton produced a patch (see A:CPM4WS4.Z80) for Wordstar 4.0 to set the
lines and columns in Wordstar from the SCB (System Control Block) of CP/M 3.1.
So you can use a terminal emulator (like mintty.exe (Cygwin/Windows), or
gnome-terminal (LinuxMint), or lxterminal (Raspbian), or ...) with lines and
columns as you wish.

The lines and columns are retriving from the SCB one time before wordstar
initializes the screen. After that initialisation the lines and columns are not
retrieving once more while Wordstar is running.
That means: When you change the coordinates of the terminal emulator while
Wordstar is running, Wordstar does not known about these changes until you
restart Wordstar again. That means: You have to define the coordinates of
the terminal emulator bevor you start Wordstar!

If you want to change the coordinates of your terminal emulator while Wordstar
is running you must firstly finish wordstar and go back to the command line of
CP/M 3.1. Then change the coordinates of your terminal emulator and then start
Wordstar again.

<a name="MHz">&nbsp;</a>
<b>13. The Z80-emulator inside YAZE-AG with for example 4000 kHz (4.0 MHz)
=======================================================================</b>

I have produced a brake in software for the z80-emulator inside yaze-ag. You
can define for example "4000" for 4000 kHz (4.0 MHz) to run the Z80-emulator
at 4 Mhz.

I have defined the new command "clock" in the monitor, so you can interactivly 
define the clockrate at that frequency the Z80-emulator then runs.

Here some examples:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A&gt;sys help clock

clock                      without argument lists the current frequency.
                           The frequency is shown in kHz and MHz.
                           If the frequency is 0 the emulator runs with
                           "max speed" as possible.

clock &lt;frequency in kHz&gt;   Set a frequency. The frequency must be in kHz.
                           For example for 4 MHz place 4000.
                           A "0" resets the emulator to max speed.


A&gt;sys clock

Frequency: max speed

A&gt;sys clock 4000

Frequency: 4000 kHz (4.0 MHz)

A&gt;sys clock

Frequency: 4000 kHz (4.0 MHz)

A&gt;sys clock 12000

Frequency: 12000 kHz (12.0 MHz)

A&gt;sys clock 0

Frequency: max speed

<b>14. Calculation of the speed
============================</b>

On drive A: is the submit file "A:TESTZEX.SUB". This runs the Z80 core tester
"ZEXALL.COM" and measure up the time how long it needs and then it calculates
at the end the speed of the Z80 core.

"ZEXALL.COM" needs 11569 seconds on a 4 MHz Z80. This is the basis for the
calculation.

<b>15. ZSM4 Macro Assembler for Z80/Z180/Z280
==========================================</b>

Now, in this final release yaze-ag-2.51.3 is the free "ZSM4.COM" Macro Assembler
the standard for assembling BOOTSYS.MAC and the BIOS3-Z80-files (*.MAC). The ZSM4-
Assembler is written in Z80 Code, so it can assemble Z180- or Z280-files on a Z80
system (or a Z80-Emulator). The ZSM4-Assembler runs also without any problem on
my real Z280-System (called CPU280, created by Tilmann Reh, town Siegen in Germany).

You find the project page at <a href="https://github.com/hperaza/ZSM4" target=_blank>https://github.com/hperaza/ZSM4</a>. The Assembler is
created by Hector Peraza. The license is the GPLv2 (GNU General Public License

    <b>The different modules</b> (I have made a lot of changes in all modules):

	yaze.c		Source of the main (only this file is different to
					    the pre release)
	yaze.h		belonging to yaze.c

	mem_mmu.c	Some definitions and routines for usage the emulated
	(new)		MMU in YAZE-AG-2.30.2.

	mem_mmu.h	The central definitions for memory access. All other
	(new)		modules uses this definitions in dependence of -DMMU
			if defined or not.

	simz80.c	The Z80 interpreter. I made a lot of changes for
			usage the MMU (over mem_mmu.h) because the memory
			access goes over the interface macros GetBYTE, GetWORD
			PutBYTE, PutWORD which are defined in mem_mmu.h. This
			macros uses the selected MMU-table to manipulate the
			Z80-memory.

			BUT I DON'T CHANGE THE ALGORITHM OF ANY Z80 INSTRUC-
			TION !!! I MADE THE CHANGES VERY CAREFULLY !!!

			The test utilities zexall.com and zexdoc.com works
			very well !!! Any instruction is OK !!!
			(see above "Optimizing")

	simz80_wts.c	The same as simz80.c, but "with t-states" of each Z80
			intruction and the software extension to run the Z80
			interpreter at a interaktive defined clock rate (see
			"clock" command in the monitor).
			This software extension is independent of the clock
			rate of the host processor! It uses the real time clock
			(RTC) of the Unix/Linux/Windows system.

	simz80.h	Definitions of the Z80-Register and some fundamental
			macros for simz80.c and other modules.

	simz80.pl	If you want to experiment with the Z80-simulator you
	(perl-file)	can use this file.
			I have transfered all changes which I made
			in simz80.c !!!
			This perl-script produce a simz80.c with all changes
			I made.

	ybios.[ch]	The yaze-bios with CP/M 3.1 extensions. It uses also
			GetBYTE, GetWORD, PutBYTE, PutWORD to manipulate the
			Z80 memory.
			The CP/M 3.1 extensions will be switched on if -DMMU
			is defined in the Makefile.

	monitor.c	The monitor for yaze-ag. 
			Now you can mount/unmount disk files under CP/M 3.1.
			You can mount/unmount UNIX directories to a CP/M
			drive, too.

	conin.c		The keytranslation module which is developed by
	keytrans.c	Jon Saxton. With this module you can use e.g. the
	ktt.h		cursor keys in the CP/M command line and if
	keytest.c	Wordstar 4.00 (see drive A:) is running.
	nulrq.c
			
			
	yaze.boot	It contains Superdos a  CP/M 2.2 replacement. I take it
			from yaze-1.10. It is used if -DBOOTSYS is NOT defined.
			You can also boot Superdos (CP/M 2.2) with

				<b>yaze -l -1 -b yaze.boot</b>


	yaze-cpm3.boot	This file contains BOOTSYS + CPM3.SYS to start
	(new)		CP/M 3.1.
			If -DBOOTSYS is defined this file will be loaded at
			0100H instead of yaze.boot (CP/M 2.2). It is the same
			file like CPM3.COM on Drive A:. I transfer it to Unix/
			Linux and name it yaze-cpm3.boot.
			It will be generated under CP/M 3.1 by P:Y.SUB with

				PIP CPM3.COM=BOOTSYS.COM,CPM3.SYS

			(If -DMMU is not defined while -DBOOTSYS is defined
			 yaze-ag will exit when the CP/M 3.1 bios starts and
			 uses funtions for the MMU or CP/M 3.1 of the
			 yaze-bios.)

	.yazerc		The startup file for yaze-ag
			(see above).

	The other files are the same as in the yaze-1.10 distribution.



    <b>yaze-DISK-Files which are defined in .yazerc:</b>

	A: BOOT_UTILS.ydsk	BOOT disk with CCP.COM some ZINC- and other
				utilities.
				See 0-README.1ST for the contents of this drive.

	B: CPM3_SYS.ydsk	Disk with all CP/M 3.1 utilities. The command
				HELP.COM gives help to all CP/M 3.1 utilities.
				(In the help file HELP.HLP I add the new
				 section "YAZE-AG".)

	C: ./disksort/		This drive is connected to the (unix-)sub-

				It contains the source files of the DISKSORT
				project. (Look drive D:)

	D: DISKSORT.ydsk	Contains the submit files and the make file to

	L: spl.ydsk		SPL development environment to compile .SPL files.
				SPL develops Peter Schorn in Switzerland.
				The files YWRITE.SPL and YREAD.SPL are in this disk
				which are compiled to A:W.COM and A:R.COM.

	M: Turbo-Modula-2.ydsk	Modula 2 Compiler of Borland
				Try the file BIRTHDAY.COM it makes some calculations
				with your birthday. <img src="happy.gif" align="middle">

	N: testdisk.ydsk	testdisk

	O: zsm4-source.ydsk	ZSM4 Macro Assembler for Z80/Z180/Z280 (source)

	P: bios3-zsm4.ydsk	The disks with which I developed the CP/M 3.1
				bios which act as an interface to the yaze-bios.
				There is also the source of BOOTSYS (Sorry the
				comments are in the german language ;-)).
				0-README.1ST declares the files containing
				in this disks. It is the same file like
				README_BIOS3_Z80.
				There is also a copy of ZPM3N10.PMA.

	On every disks are a file with the name 0-README.1ST. This file
	describes the contents of the disk.

<b>17. Optimizing and speedtest:
=============================</b>

	I made also some work for optimize in simz80.c.
	If you compile yaze-ag-2.30.2 without -DMMU and
	without -DBOOTSYS, yaze-ag-2.30.2 will be compiled
	like the last yaze version (yaze-1.10) with only
	64K and the default use of CP/M 2.2 (yaze.boot).

	On my Notebook with 2,9 GHz (corei7)

	  SAVAGE.COM needs:
		yaze-2.30.3     0.265 secs (with MMU)
		4.0MHz Z80     65.000 secs

	  Zexall.com needs:
		yaze-2.30.2    25.849 secs (with MMU)
		4.0MHz Z80  11688.000 secs (reference, 3.25 h)

	  That correlates rather a ~ 1808.65 MHz Z80 (with MMU)

	On my 2,66 GHz Linux Server YAZE-AG runs like
	a Z80 with 1.558 GHz ;-) (Zexall needs only 30 seconds against
	3,25 hours on an original Z80 with 4 MHz!!!)
	Thats very good to compile/develop software for the Z280 system :-)

	(messured with unix command "time")

<b>18. My old real Z80 System:
===========================</b>

I have at home an old Z80 ECB-Bus-Sytem (4Mhz) (1982-1989). The terminal
is an another ECB-BUS-Card and is it's own Z80-System with a CRT-Chip from
Motorola. To the ECB-Bus it schows like a 8251 Intel Chip and it is very fast.

For some ECB-Bus cards (CPU-, RAM-, Floppy-Card) of this system exists
a CP/M 3.1 implementation of a german company, but I made a lot of extensions.
So I add some ECB-Bus cards:
	a RAM-disk with 1,2 MB,
	an EPROM-Disk with 256 KB,
	a CMOS-RAM-disk with 64KB and a battery (on this is CPM3.SYS),
	an ECB-Bus-Card as a harddisk interface to an OMTI 5510 (IBM-XT
	   HD controller) with an old 5 MB HD ;-) ,
	and a Card with a clock.

I made the bios extension succesive for this new 4 drives and the clock.

I think I have through this work a lot of practise to develop a CP/M 3.1 bios
and this contribute the development of the bios and yaze-bios of yaze-ag.
