YAZE-AG(1)             Frank, John Saxton and AGL Hacks             YAZE-AG(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       yaze-ag - yet another z80 emulator by ag

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>yaze</b>  [<b>-1</b>]  [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-b</b>bootfile] [<b>-l</b>loadadr] [<b>-p</b>basepage] [<b>-s</b>startup]
       [<b>-z</b>Z3ENV] command...
       <b>cpm ...</b>
       <b>z80 ...</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>yaze-ag</b> has been designed to provide an exact simulation of the Z80 mi&minus;
       croprocessor  on a Unix system. In addition to the instruction set emu&minus;
       lator, a CP/M basic i/o system is provided that can reference Unix  di&minus;
       rectories  and Unix files containing images of CP/M disks.  When a gen&minus;
       uine CP/M operating system (ccp + bdos) or a  clone  system  is  loaded
       into the emulator, a complete CP/M system is available, running on a
       Unix-/Linux-/RaspberryPi-/Mac-/Windows-Host.

       <b>yaze-ag-2.51.3</b> is a further development of yaze-1.10. New in yaze-ag is
       the emulated Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the  BIOS  that  supports
       CP/M  3.1  or ZPM3 (boot file yaze-cpm3.boot) which is used in yaze-ag.
       You can still run  the  CP/M  2.2  replacement  "SuperDos"  (boot  file
       yaze.boot) in yaze-ag if you want.

       New  in  version  <b>2.40.5</b> was the key translation module. So you can use
       e.g. the cursor keys and function keys in the CP/M command line or when
       Wordstar is running. Look at the files $HOME/cpm/*.ktt on the host.

       New  in version <b>2.51.1</b> was the possibility to define a clock rate. This
       allows you to run the emulator e.g. with 4.0 MHz.
       Further there is a "window size handler" in the binary of yaze-ag. This
       handler  determines the coordinates of the used Terminal emulator (e.g.
       xterm, gnome-terminal, mintty (Cygwin/Windows), ...). So the lines  and
       columns  variables  in the System Control Block (SCB) of CP/M-3 are set
       by this handler.  The patched Wordstar 4.00  (see  drive  A:)  and  the
       CP/M-3-Utilities  (e.g. TYPE.COM, 3DIR.COM, DIR.COM, ...) uses this two
       variables in the SCB via  the  standardized  BDOS3-Interface  (call  to
       0005H) to setup the screen.
       Further  you  can  test  the speed of the Z80 core with the submit file
       "A:TESTZEX.SUB". It runs ZEXALL.COM and measure up the  time  how  it's
       need and prints the speed at the end of the submit file.

       New   in   version  <b>2.51.2</b>  is  the  Macro  Assembler  "ZSM4".  It's  a
       Z80/Z180/Z280 Assembler. The licence is the GPLv2 (GNU  GENERAL  PUBLIC
       LICENSE    Version    2,    June    1991).    The   project   page   is
       "<a href="https://github.com/hperaza/ZSM4" target=_blank>https://github.com/hperaza/ZSM4</a>". The source files of  this  Assembler
       can  be mounted on drive O:. This Assembler is now the standard for as&minus;
       semble BOOTSYS and the BIOS3-Z80-files for YAZE-AG (see drive P:).
       Further with the flag "-?" you can print the  usage,  the  features  of
       yaze-ag and at last it prints the copyright report.

       New  in  version  <b>2.51.3</b> is "BOOTSYS version 2.00". When you call BOOT-
       SYS.COM it tries to open A:CPM3.SYS.  Where A: is the  drive  which  is
       defined as the default drive in BOOTSYS.MAC (see drive P:).
       You can define a drive as a parameter (e.g. "bootsys p:" (the colon ist
       necessary)). BOOTSYS tries to open CPM3.SYS on that drive.  After  load
       of CPM3.SYS it relocates CPM3.SYS and starts CP/M 3.1 (cold boot).
       An  another way to load CPM 3.1 is to generate a CPM3.COM with the fol-
       lowing command:

                    A>pip cpm3.com=bootsys.com,cpm3.sys

       You simple append CPM3.SYS after BOOTSYS.COM and save both in CPM3.COM.
       When  you call CPM3.COM BOOTSYS tests if a CPM3.SYS is appended and re-
       locates at once CPM3.SYS and starts CP/M 3.1 (cold boot).
       The boot file "yaze-cpm3.boot" which is load when you start YAZE-AG  is
       identical with A:CPM3.COM.

       <b>yaze</b> is a shell script. It is used to start yaze-ag.  It first tests if
       the startup file <b>.yazerc</b> is in the current directory. If there is  one,
       it immediately starts <b>yaze_bin</b> the binary of the Z80 emulator.
       If  .yazerc does not exist, it tests if the directory $HOME/cpm exists.
       If not, it creates $HOME/cpm.  Then  it  copies  some  yaze-disks-files
       (.ydsk)  to $HOME/cpm which are necessary for running yaze-ag with CP/M
       3.1 or ZPM3.  Then it creates $HOME/cpm/doc_html and sets links to  the
       complete documentation in this directory.  This only happens if the di&minus;
       rectory $HOME/cpm does not exists.
       Finally, it changes to $HOME/cpm and starts <b>yaze_bin</b>.  This is done ev&minus;
       ery  time you start the shell script yaze and if .yazerc is not present
       in the current directory.

       yaze-ag can also be started with <b>z80</b> or <b>cpm</b>.  They are  symbolic  links
       to the shell script yaze.

       The  older  documentation  is  contained  in the file yaze.doc (version
       yaze-1.10) and the new features until yaze-ag-2.51.3 describes the file
       yaze-ag.doc
       (see $HOME/cpm/doc_html/index.html).

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-?</b>     prints the Usage, the Features and the Copyrights.

       <b>-1</b>     set sector size to 128 bytes for all disks (only CP/M 3.1).

              If  you create a disk file under the yaze-ag monitor or with the
              cdm(1) utility and you use the default sectors  per  track  (see
              create)  the  sector  size  is also set to 2048 bytes (only CP/M
              3.1).

              If you use software like a disk edit utility under CP/M  3.1  it
              can be necessary to set the sector size to 128 bytes.

              See  also  the  monitor command <b>128</b> above in the section MONITOR
              COMMANDS.

       <b>-v</b>     causes a summary of the system configuration to be displayed af&minus;
              ter loading.

       <b>-b</b>     gives  the name of a file to be loaded into the emulated proces&minus;
              sor's ram before the emulation is started.  The file  is  loaded
              at  the  address  given  by the <b>-l</b> option, if one is present, or
              else at the basepage (see <b>-p</b>).  If a boot file is not  specified
              with  the  <b>-b</b>  option,  yaze-ag looks firstly for the file yaze-
              cpm3.boot in the current directory, then in  /usr/local/lib/yaze
              to  boot  CP/M  3.1.   If  yaze-ag  is compiled without the flag
              -DBOOTSYS yaze-ag looks for the file yaze.boot (instead of yaze-
              cpm3.boot) to boot the CP/M 2.2 replacement Superdos.

       <b>-l</b>     the hexadecimal address at which to load and start the bootstrap
              file, if a separate bootstrap is necessary.

              If you want to run CP/M 2.2 while yaze-ag is  compiled  to  load
              yaze-cpm3.boot (CP/M 3.1) you can start yaze-ag with the follow&minus;
              ing options:

              <b>yaze -l -1 -b yaze.boot</b>

       <b>-p</b>     the top 2 hex digits of the location of the CP/M console command
              processor  (CP/M  2.2).  Also the location to which boot file is
              loaded if a -l option is not present.

       <b>-s</b>     a file containing monitor commands that are to be  executed  be&minus;
              fore starting the emulator.  If no -s option is present, .yazerc
              from the current directory or from  the  user's  home  directory
              ($HOME/cpm) is taken.

       <b>-z</b>     the  hexadecimal  address  in  the emulated processor's ram of a
              1KByte area that should be reserved for use by an extended  CP/M
              clone such as ZCPR3.

<b>MONITOR COMMANDS</b>
       When  the  emulator  is  started  it  executes  commands first from the
       startup file "<b>.yazerc</b>", then from the tail of  the  command  line  (any
       strings  which follow the options) and then from the tty if neither the
       startup file nor the command line included a "go" command.  Control can
       be returned to the monitor by executing the CP/M sys.com command or, if
       yaze was compiled with -DDEBUG, by sending it a SIGINT signal.

       Command names can be shortened to unique abbreviations.  If <b>yaze-ag</b> was
       compiled  with  GNU Readline, command-line editing, filename completion
       and history recall are available - see the readline documentation.

       The monitor commands are  described  with  more  details  in  the  file
       yaze.doc.   The  new  commands  '128'  and  'clock'  are  described  in
       yaze-ag.doc.

       <b>help</b>   Display a command list

       <b>help</b> cmd
	      Give details about cmd

       <b>attach</b> Attach CP/M device to a Unix file

       <b>clock</b>  Display and set the clock rate

              Without a parameter it displays the current clock rate.  With  a
              parameter  (for example 4000 for 4.0 MHz) the clock rate will be
              set. The parameter "0" returns to "max speed".
              If you want to set a permanent clock rate you can  put  a  clock
              command into the yaze-ag startup file $HOME/cpm/.yazerc.

       <b>detach</b> Detach CP/M device from file
       
       <b>setaccess</b>
       	      Turns on/off access time stamps for mounted directories

       <b>mount</b>  Mount a Unix file or directory as a CP/M disk
       
       <b>remount</b>
	      Remount a CP/M disk

       <b>umount</b> Unmount a CP/M disk

       <b>create</b> Create a new disk

       <b>128</b>    Set  sector  size  to 128 for all disks (only CP/M 3.1).  To re&minus;
              verse this option you have to restart yaze-ag.

       <b>interrupt</b>
	      Set user interrupt key

       <b>go</b>     Start/Continue CP/M execution

       <b>!</b>      Execute a Unix command

       <b>quit</b>   Terminate yaze

       <b>time</b>   Display elapsed time since last `time' command
